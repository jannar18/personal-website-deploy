## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## First-time Setup

To automatically run `npm run build` before every push (blocks push if build fails):

```bash
npm run setup-hooks
```

This only needs to be run once per computer.

## Deployment

This site is deployed on Netlify and automatically updates when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Built with React and Claude.
