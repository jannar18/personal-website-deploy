    content: `Yesterday I arrived in my new Brooklyn apartment at 11:00pm at night. This morning at 10:30am I met for coffee to discuss the game plan for how I'm going to gain skills in AI, writing and branding over the next 90 days under a graduate program level of intensity and structure. By 11:00am I was at the office, installing Claude Desktop.

My goal: To create a personal website I'm proud of, deploy it, and write a blog post about the experience within the workday by only interacting with Claude interfaces and no other applications.

The tasks and advice I was given were to:
LISTITEM:Set-up Claude - both the desktop and Claude Code
SUBITEM:To run Claude Code in the "Ghostie" terminal which I later learned was actually the Ghostty terminal
LISTITEM:Learn about Claude skills using Claude
SUBITEM:What are its valuable skills?
SUBITEM:How does Claude learn these skills?
SUBITEM:What are Claude's most valuable skills?
SUBITEM:What skills will I need to make my blog?
LISTITEM:Spend some time doing Metacognitive Thinking
LISTITEM:Evaluate if Claude is BS'ing me
LISTITEM:Evaluate if Claude is gassing me up
LISTITEM:Design the personal website with Claude
LISTITEM:Deploy the Blog
SUBITEM:Come up with a deployment plan
SUBITEM:Be able to explain the steps of deployment
LISTITEM:Publish this Blog

I am an architectural designer.

So I began:

TIMESTAMP:10:30
LISTITEM:Looked up Claude on Google and downloaded
LISTITEM:Used Claude in browser to look up how to install Claude Code and use the Ghostie terminal
LISTITEM:Learned I need Homebrew
LISTITEM:Asked Claude how to check if Homebrew is installed
LISTITEM:It was not installed
LISTITEM:Began to install Homebrew with the code Claude provided

TIMESTAMP:11:40
LISTITEM:Became confused about password request… a bit embarrassing
LISTITEM:Claude confirmed I won't see the password but to just type my macOS user password
LISTITEM:While waiting for the Homebrew install I attempted to Connect Claude Desktop to my google account and did some wifi troubleshooting

TIMESTAMP:11:50
LISTITEM:I spent some time asking Claude about Claude Code versus Desktop and if I could work on setting anything else up for my blog while I waited for Homebrew to install
LISTITEM:I asked Claude about what its skills are and learned that some of them are: docx, pptx, xlsx, pdf, front-end-design, product-self-knowledge, and skill-creator
LISTITEM:I asked Claude how it learns and understands these and learned it retrieves files, reads them to remind itself/ensure it is referencing the most updated practices
LISTITEM:I asked Claude its most valuable skills. In response it just excitedly retold me its skills again…? But it seemed to think its ability to analyze and create documents was the most important along with front-end-design because it is capable of creating polished react based websites
LISTITEM:I determined that I should ask Claude to focus on the front-end-design skill
LISTITEM:It was perfect timing because I thought I could finally use Claude Code! It turns out I couldn't yet because my macOS software was out of date… RIP

TIMESTAMP:12:22
LISTITEM:I wanted to keep moving so it was here that decided to make this website using Claude Desktop
DIALOGUE:"I'd like to build a polished personal website for publishing blogs and artifacts using your front-end design skill"
LISTITEM:I confirmed with Claude that I could do this and we began
LISTITEM:Claude asked me the following:
NUMBERED:1. Your field/focus area
NUMBERED:2. The aesthetic vibe you're going for
NUMBERED:3. Whether you want single-page HTML or React
NUMBERED:4. What content you want featured (blog list, projects, about section, etc.)
LISTITEM:Response:
NUMBERED:1. I am a recent architecture graduate from Illinois Tech. I completed a 5 year B.Arch program and I'm now going through a custom graduate program in which I will be rapidly growing my AI, writing, and marketing/branding skills.
NUMBERED:2. I like feminine and japanese aesthetics, a mix of both modern + retro aesthetic would be good. I like desert colors, muted colors, feminine colors, earth tones etc. I want it to seem professional but not so polished and complete that it is missing the quality of active working and research.
NUMBERED:3. I would like to use React elements.
NUMBERED:4. I would like some sort of about me, a blog list, and a project section for artifacts
LISTITEM:I didn't think too hard about these responses at all

TIMESTAMP:12:35
LISTITEM:I had a website that was beautiful and I could deploy
LISTITEM:I asked for a home page
LISTITEM:Asked for edits on the header of the home page
LISTITEM:And got called into a meeting

TIMESTAMP:1:32
LISTITEM:I came back excited to know my software would be updated and I could use Claude Code.
LISTITEM:I asked Claude what the best method for editing the infill text is. One of its suggestions was using Claude Code and I really thought I had it installed at this point.
LISTITEM:It was here I started asking Claude about the Ghostie terminal
DIALOGUE:"Ah! I don't actually know what "Ghostie terminal" refers to - I assumed you were using a nickname for your terminal app, but now I'm realizing you might be referring to something specific that I'm not familiar with."
LISTITEM:I felt a bit dumb…
LISTITEM:So I moved on and simplified: "How do I run Claude Code?"
LISTITEM:I spent a long long time asking Claude how to run Claude Code and it kept telling me to type claude or claude-code in many different ways. This seemed odd to me. Shouldn't the command be simple? Claude was so convinced that I might have actually installed Claude Code already or that I should figure out how to run it with my out of date macOS software that it had me check to see if the terminal recognized Claude Code as an app? I apologize if this is getting confusing, this is where it got confusing for me, and I definitely could have hyper-analyzed it but instead I kept showing Claude the terminal responses and let it take me on this cyclical journey of continuing to prompt my terminal to open Claude Code and getting 'command not found' in response to every single one.

TIMESTAMP:1:47
DIALOGUE:"None of these are working"
LISTITEM:I don't understand how…but my software update stopped sometime during the meeting and I had to restart it. RIP!
LISTITEM:Dealing with this was a ridiculous time sink
LISTITEM:I started the update again and continued to edit the website with Claude Desktop

TIMESTAMP:1:50
LISTITEM:I asked Claude to be analytical about the site and think about anything we were missing that typically goes into a personal website
LISTITEM:From this conversation I asked Claude to use its pdf skill, uploaded my resume and had it implement the resume as both a separate section on the site and on the about page to see which worked better on the site
LISTITEM:From here I was in a good flow state asking for small detailed edits on the text and then editing all of the infill text to pertain to my actual information
LISTITEM:It was awesome that Claude could show me the updates visually in real time
LISTITEM:I was having a lot of fun

TIMESTAMP:2:30
LISTITEM:I mentioned to Claude that I was ready to write my blog post and asked it to clear all of the made up blog post containers
LISTITEM:After this update it assumed we were done editing and gave me a .jsx file to download
LISTITEM:Oddly enough it stopped displaying the visuals I had been seeing, I didn't know what those containers looked like anymore
LISTITEM:Claude tried to tell me that it couldn't pull up the visuals anymore… why would it do this? It just didn't want to run the artifact again, but it kept telling me "I can't"…which was interesting
LISTITEM:I was ready to write so I decided to take a lunch break

TIMESTAMP:3:30
LISTITEM:I uploaded a profile picture to implement and ran into an issue where Claude couldn't convert the HEIC to JPEG
LISTITEM:It also didn't have authorized access to my local files so it couldn't run the profile picture in the artifact visual
LISTITEM:More edits, writing the about page etc.

TIMESTAMP:4:17
LISTITEM:I decided to deploy the site
LISTITEM:Turns out Claude Code was still not installed and was still not installing with the commands Claude was providing me
LISTITEM:I thought back to the advice given to me and remembered the Ghostie terminal! I decided to cheat and look this up on google because Claude seemed to have no clue what I was talking about…
LISTITEM:This is where I finally learned after hours that I had been making a huge dumb mistake!! Ghostty, it is called the Ghostty terminal

DIALOGUE:Me: "I think part of the issue is that i dont have the ghostty terminal"
DIALOGUE:Claude: "Ah! You're right - Claude Code requires the Ghostty terminal. Let's install Ghostty first:"

TERMINAL:Installation Successful!

I typed claudecode into the Ghostty terminal as suggested by Claude…

TERMINAL:command not found

RIP… truly rip.

I had just told Liam I was having so much fun… sigh

I'm going to be honest after this I went back into the same cycle with Claude, this time I copied all the responses from terminal and fed them to Claude Desktop who I had been working with all day. After a whirlwind journey….we had finally located the path to Claude Code. I knew this because a cute little pixel creature showed up on my screen. I smiled.

DIALOGUE:Me: "okay that was a bit confusing for me but claude code now opens with the claude command"

DIALOGUE:Claude: "Perfect! That's all that matters - you got it working! 🎉 Now you can just type claude in your terminal and Claude Code will open."

Relief.

TIMESTAMP:4:40

Goal: Deploy the Site
LISTITEM:Claude asked me if I had used any deployment platforms before
SUBITEM:I had: Github and Netlify
LISTITEM:Claude told me a plan and asked if it should begin preparing for deployment
LISTITEM:I said yes and told it to explain the deployment steps:

CODEBLOCK:personal-website-deploy/
├── package.json (dependencies & scripts)
├── .gitignore (files to ignore in git)
├── README.md (documentation)
├── public/
│   ├── index.html (main HTML file)
│   └── profile-pic.jpg (your photo)
└── src/
    ├── index.js (entry point)
    └── App.jsx (your website component)

Claude told me the next steps were to:
NUMBERED:1. download the file and extract
NUMBERED:2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder (cd personal-website-deploy)
NUMBERED:3. Install dependencies (npm install)
NUMBERED:4. Test it locally (npm start)

DIALOGUE:Me: "I still need to finish reading but what is npm?"

TIMESTAMP:4:56
LISTITEM:I followed all of the above deployment steps but when I ran it locally in my browser a scary red ERROR paragraph appeared :(
LISTITEM:Claude had forgotten to close the <main> tags
LISTITEM:A couple of different errors showed up and I continued to replace the App.jsx file

TIMESTAMP:5:05
LISTITEM:I remember I needed to change the really odd quote Claude had put onto my about page
LISTITEM:I chose one from Christopher Alexander's book "The Timeless Way of Building"

TIMESTAMP:5:17
LISTITEM:My personal website was successfully running locally
LISTITEM:The last steps were to push to GitHub
LISTITEM:Claude Code told me that to use GitHub I needed to install Xcode command line tools… the install was going to take forever… not this again
LISTITEM:Turns out the easiest thing for me to do here would have been to use the manual skills I had and push it myself using GitHub Desktop and Netlify
LISTITEM:I started documenting my experience today while I was waiting but eventually decided to use GitHub Desktop myself
LISTITEM:I successfully published to GitHub and asked Claude if it had any ability to publish to Netlify for me - it said it didn't have that ability

TIMESTAMP:6:10
LISTITEM:I published to Netlify
TERMINAL:ERROR
LISTITEM:Claude had put an invalid href
LISTITEM:Updated the App.jsx
TERMINAL:ERROR

TIMESTAMP:6:15
LISTITEM:I was reminded around this time to check the model of Claude I was using. My Claude Code was set to Opus 4.5 - good. Claude Desktop however was set to Sonnet 4.5 instead of Opus 4.5 :'(
LISTITEM:I showed the errors to Claude in Opus 4.5
LISTITEM:It wanted to find my files by connecting to google? This was annoying and didn't work…
LISTITEM:I instead gave it the file path to my project
LISTITEM:I attempted to see if Claude Code could commit changes to the main branch and push to origin
LISTITEM:It did commit the changes - very cool!
LISTITEM:But it said I needed to install GitHub CLI in order for the push to origin to work
LISTITEM:I clicked push to origin myself
LISTITEM:Opened my browser and there was my website, successfully published on the World Wide Web with Netlify!

CLOSING:Now I just need to have Claude check this for errors, and add in an actual page for this blog post…`

NOTE:It is interesting to note that Claude organized these notes for me with no direction. I'm not sure I would organize them the same way, but I also thought it was curious to keep it around like this.

Here are the ideas left floating at the top of my mind after reading yesterday:

HEADER:Key Concepts
LISTITEM:The Crusonia plant
LISTITEM:Sustainable economic growth
LISTITEM:Wealth Plus
LISTITEM:Human rights
LISTITEM:Pluralism
LISTITEM:Time distance horizon
LISTITEM:Faith

HEADER:Philosophical Framework
LISTITEM:Radical uncertainty breaks down arguments for consequentialism over human rights
LISTITEM:Common sense morality ruled the book
LISTITEM:Intuitions of right or wrong feel good — but is it the right way to think of things? Can we trust ourselves and our brain?
LISTITEM:Our minds can be uncertain and irrational
LISTITEM:Right and wrong are objective and powerful
LISTITEM:Cowen believes in absolute human rights — so we just assume human rights are intrinsic
LISTITEM:We need to lessen the moral distance we have with future generations and have faith in the future
LISTITEM:We have a moral imperative to have a deep concern for the distant future
LISTITEM:Epistemic critique → why we should respect individual rights
LISTITEM:Radical uncertainty gives us the freedom to act morally
LISTITEM:Issue of rights is not strictly absolute in the case of the end of the world — lifeboat ethics
LISTITEM:Even if rights are not always absolute (like in a case of the world ending), we have a rights theory where rights are mostly absolute at least in a world in which the Crusonia plants and the froth of consequentialist uncertainty exist
LISTITEM:Common sense morality and intuition are deeply connected to what is right

HEADER:Questions / Tensions
LISTITEM:Is there such a thing as free lunches? Crusonia plant is a free lunch
LISTITEM:Time may reveal free lunches — we should think more distantly
LISTITEM:When in doubt, choose the Crusonia plant
LISTITEM:What is the difference between rules and rights?
LISTITEM:Are negative rights rules?
LISTITEM:How do we define civilization?
LISTITEM:Why does he bring up the Solow model versus increasing returns model?
LISTITEM:Do all fruitful societies require faith?

HEADER:Economic Arguments
LISTITEM:GDP should be measured to include Wealth Plus (human welfare, etc.)
LISTITEM:Crusonia plant can solve issues of aggregation
LISTITEM:If we are thinking in a long time horizon, utilitarian thinking may lead us to conclude that it is more beneficial to redistribute to the wealthy and improve trickle down effects
LISTITEM:We should instead focus on Crusonia plants and overall choose the path of greatest good/value/sustainable economic growth
LISTITEM:Ideas are the wellspring of economic growth

HEADER:Personal Experience as a Reader
LISTITEM:As a newbie to this field, many terms were new and left my head spinning in certain moments
LISTITEM:Difficult to summarize conclusions or takeaways in certain moments
LISTITEM:Surprised by lack of tech talk

HEADER:Broader Takeaways
LISTITEM:We are in an investment drought
LISTITEM:Institutions are important
LISTITEM:"Crusonia plants reign supreme"
LISTITEM:We should stick to our rules and rights rigidly
LISTITEM:Greater sustainable economic growth
LISTITEM:We are most likely wrong — we should be skeptical of really particular instruments built to promote good
LISTITEM:Freedom and prosperity are valuable
LISTITEM:We should be more charitable
LISTITEM:Choose the Crusonia plant unless it is obvious like the world is ending or human rights intervene
LISTITEM:Ideas are the foundation of value in society

SECTION:The Crusonia Plant

For the sake of not overthinking this blog post, I will just say I am still unsure of my conclusions of this book. That's not satisfying to say, but I feel that my lack of knowledge in this field is enough to not trust my conclusions, at least not enough to state them concretely, yet. What I do know is that my instincts tell me chasing Crusonia plants sounds fun, it seems valuable to chase them, and I am definitely convinced by their power.

Cowen didn't create the Crusonia plant. He revived the idea, originally created by economist Frank Knight, to provide an example of a free lunch. The Crusonia plant is:

QUOTE:...a mythical, automatically growing crop which generates more output each period. If you lay the seeds, the plant just grows; you don't have to water it or tend to it.

Cowen argues that the analogy of the Crusonia plant can solve issues of aggregation. "When in doubt, choose the Crusonia plant" — easy. In other words, Cowen sets up a principle in which we should aim to identify choices or policies that are equivalent to the "unceasing yield, namely ongoing and self-sustaining surges in value" of the Crusonia plant.

I think it is important to note that the strength of the Crusonia plant relies, in some ways, on the assumption that we have a deep concern for the future. Throughout the book, I often found the Crusonia plant to be a guiding force. No matter the terms or argument, the Crusonia plant reigned supreme as the aim. The only cases in which this wasn't true were: one, the scenario in which the world is ending, and two, respecting the rules of human rights when applicable.

SECTION:When Not to Choose the Crusonia Plant

Although Cowen's Crusonia plant is an obvious push for choosing paths of greater economic growth, it's important to note that Cowen's primary goal is to return to a society based on good principles; human rights became a primary topic of the discussion.

QUOTE:We need to develop a tougher, more dedicated, and indeed a more stubborn attachment to prosperity and freedom.

He begins the book with a framework that ignores meta-ethics, states that there is an objective right or wrong, and assumes we as readers have an intuition of what that right or wrong is in any given scenario. He also recognizes both the limitations of the human mind and the fundamental messiness to the nature of good, holding pluralism as a core moral intuition.

Interestingly enough, when asked what Cowen said about human rights or why he argued their importance, I couldn't remember an answer. This is partially because when he first brings up The Principle of Growth Plus Rights, he simply states that we should think of rights as binding and absolute — we ought not to violate human rights. Later in Chapter 6, the argument for human rights becomes clearer when he discusses the epistemic critique:

QUOTE:We should choose the course that is most likely to be correct, keeping in mind that at the end of the day we are still more likely to be wrong than right.

Our radical uncertainty is actually the key to our freedom to act morally; since we most likely cannot predict the outcome of our actions, when faced with a frothy chance at high economic growth versus a path that protects human rights, we ought to just choose the path that protects human rights. There is a chance that choosing that path can also lead to beneficial economic growth.

SECTION:Great Ideas Are the Crusonia Plants?

Towards the end of the book, Cowen discusses once-and-for-all changes vs. growth rate changes by comparing the Solow Model and the Increasing Returns Model. The Solow Model is known as the most prominent economic approach to growth where "...national output is the result of capital inputs, labor inputs, and technological progress." One of the strengths of this model is its ability to provide quick economic recovery after one-time negative shocks. Boosts in savings and investment support fast catch-up growth during transition growth paths but do not provide long-run growth rates.

The Increasing Returns Model indicates growth leads to more growth; "...larger markets generate stronger incentives for idea production because innovators can sell their products to a larger market..." In this case, more growth continues to lead to new ideas, which leads to more growth. Here he says something interesting:

QUOTE:Once an idea has been generated, it can be used many times by many different people at very low marginal cost. The first idea spreads, begets subsequent ideas, and so growth increases.

The weakness of this model is that any negative shocks will shrink the economy and limit future growth rates without the catch-up methods that the Solow Model has.

The point of his discussion wasn't to pick which one of these models is better (which did confuse me at first). The point of discussing these models was to highlight that both "...emphasize ideas as the wellspring of economic growth." Ideas are fundamental to a world in which we aim to continue to chase paths leading to greater sustainable economic growth. This is very cool to me.

QUOTE:New ideas are the product of human reason; it was Aristotle who defined man as the rational animal. A preoccupation with pursuing growth—or some modified version of the growth ideal—therefore means a preoccupation with ideas, a preoccupation with cultivating human reason, and a preoccupation with the notion that man should realize, perfect, and extend his nature as a generator of powerful ideas that can change the world.

We live in a world of Crusonia plants. Cowen's ability to use such a strong idea to explain his arguments, in a book that arguably concludes with this message, has definitely caused me to be biased towards trusting the rest of his ideas.`

    content: `Swept up by a call to romanticize a cozy, snow-filled Saturday in Brooklyn, I failed today's assignment. I was meant to consume the entirety of William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White's Elements of Style and skim Joseph M. Williams and Gregory G. Colomb's Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace, but found myself in want of conversation, daydreams and daily rituals; I indulged. A borrowed room came to be my sacred home, as my window frame came to be a portrait of the illuminating moon.

SEPARATOR:

I decided to experiment:

DIALOGUE:Me: Does the above paragraph follow the rules I mentioned from the book? Point out where I failed and succeeded.

DIALOGUE:Claude: Great exercise - testing your own writing against the book you're reading. Let me break it down:

Successes:
LISTITEM:"I failed today's assignment" — Direct. Active voice. Clear subject-verb.
LISTITEM:"I indulged." — Punchy. Strunk would approve. Omits needless words.
LISTITEM:Concrete imagery: "snow-filled Saturday in Brooklyn," "borrowed room," "sacred home," "portrait of the illuminating moon" — Specific, not vague.

Where Strunk & White Might Push Back:
LISTITEM:"came to be" appears twice — very wordy. Strunk would say: use "became." The repetition amplifies the issue.
LISTITEM:"found myself in want of" — Elegant but wordy. "I wanted conversation" is half the words.
LISTITEM:"Swept up by a call to romanticize" — Passive-ish construction. Who's calling? Could be tightened: "Called to romanticize..." or "Romanticizing a cozy, snow-filled Saturday..."
LISTITEM:"the entirety of" — Could just be "all of" or omitted entirely.

DIALOGUE:Claude: This tension itself could be the blog post — you failing to follow the rules in a post about failing to finish the book about rules.

SEPARATOR:

Edit A:

Called to romanticize a cozy and snow-filled Saturday in Brooklyn, I failed today's assignment. I was meant to consume William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White's Elements of Style and skim Joseph M. Williams and Gregory G. Colomb's Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace, but I wanted conversation, daydreams and daily rituals; I indulged. A borrowed room became my sacred home, as my window frame became a portrait of the illuminating moon.

Changes Made:
LISTITEM:"Swept up by a call" → "Called" — tighter, more active
LISTITEM:"the entirety of" → cut — omitted needless words
LISTITEM:"found myself in want of" → "I wanted" — direct
LISTITEM:"came to be" → "became" (×2) — simpler

But Wait — Claude Never Received My Notes

NOTE:Claude must have assumed rules about the book from other sources, not my own notes, because a message send error prevented them from coming through. Here are Claude's critiques of my paragraph based on the notes I sent:

Section 1:
LISTITEM:Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas — ✓ "cozy, snow-filled Saturday" correctly uses commas
LISTITEM:Place comma before conjunction introducing independent clause — ✓ "...Grace, but found myself..." — comma before "but" is correct
LISTITEM:Do not join independent clauses with a comma — ✓ I use a semicolon correctly: "rituals; I indulged"
LISTITEM:Do not break sentences in two — ✓ No sentence fragments

Section 2:
LISTITEM:Use the active voice — ✗ "Swept up by a call" is passive. Who calls?
LISTITEM:Use the positive form — ✓ No weak "not" constructions
LISTITEM:Use definite, specific, concrete language — ✓ "snow-filled Saturday in Brooklyn," "borrowed room," "sacred home," "portrait of the illuminating moon" — vivid
LISTITEM:Keep related words together — ✓ Generally well-structured
LISTITEM:Place what is most prominent at the end — ✓ "portrait of the illuminating moon" ends with strong imagery

Section 4:
LISTITEM:Avoid listed words — ✓ None of the forbidden words appear

Summary:
LISTITEM:Successes: Strong punctuation, concrete imagery, positive form, prominent ending
LISTITEM:Failure: Passive voice in opening ("Swept up by a call")

My Notes:

HEADER:Section 1: Elementary Rules of Usage
LISTITEM:Rules 3, 4, 5 and 6 cover the most important principles that govern punctuation: enclose parenthetic expressions between commas, place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause, do not join independent clauses with a comma, do not break sentences in two.
LISTITEM:Why are 3, 4, 5 + 6 the most important principles?
LISTITEM:What is the grammatical subject vs. the subject?
LISTITEM:In order to understand whether a sentence is right or wrong, it is crucial to break sentences down into their parts. I have a weak habit of practicing this.
LISTITEM:What does Elementary Rules of Usage mean?

HEADER:Section 2: Elementary Principles of Composition
LISTITEM:Effective writing calls for a scheme of procedure; the first principle of composition is to determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.
LISTITEM:The paragraph is a convenient unit and a good visual help.
LISTITEM:Use the active voice.
LISTITEM:Use the positive form. "Not" is weak. The reader wishes to be told what is.
LISTITEM:Be assertive; save the auxiliaries.
LISTITEM:Use definite, specific, concrete language: "He grinned as he pocketed the coin."
LISTITEM:Use specific language; call up pictures with your words.
LISTITEM:Omit "the fact that," "who is," and "which was" from your writing vocabulary.
LISTITEM:Keep related words together. "There was a stir in the audience that suggested disapproval" vs. "A stir that suggested disapproval swept the audience." "She only found two mistakes" vs. "She found only two mistakes."
LISTITEM:After the initial notification, waste no words in repeating the notification of an author/speaker.
LISTITEM:Place what is to be made most prominent, word, sentence or paragraph, at the end.

HEADER:Section 3: A Few Matters of Form
LISTITEM:Quotations are more complex than I've practiced in my writing.

HEADER:Section 4: Words and Expressions Commonly Misused
LISTITEM:There are many words and phrases to eliminate from my use: and/or, anticipate, case, character, currently, each and every one, facility, factor, feature, "he is a man who," importantly, in terms of, meaningful, "one of the most," personally, respective, respectively, secondly, thirdly etc., "the truth is," utilize, while.
LISTITEM:"Get" is complex. Be careful of "would."`

    content: `Hello, world. Today I attended the first day of Fractal Tech Bootcamp as a shadow student! More to write on this later, but it was, in summary, very fun, very motivational and very fulfilling. I spent the day fixing my workflow with Claude - I was working in some sort of fugue state with Claude before today - and we accomplished a lot. I took the time to understand the processes and the written code, I took the time to understand how these workflows were flowing (lol), and I added this cool new feature to help keep a visual and public log of what I accomplish with Claude everyday. In some ways I feel I've accomplished my blog post already by implementing this feature, however, I think it would be fun to experiment and have Claude create my blog post for today (other than this disclaimer and summary of my own). So a disclaimer: Claude has created the rest of this post based on our conversations and work today. Enjoy.

SECTION:What We Set Out To Do

Today's session began with a simple goal: improve our workflow. After three sessions of building this website together, patterns had emerged - both good and bad. We needed to step back and analyze what was working and what wasn't.

The goals we established:

LISTITEM:Identify issues and improve our workflow
LISTITEM:Automate the PR deployment process (previously manual)
LISTITEM:Establish a local testing workflow
LISTITEM:Assess the risks of using Claude
LISTITEM:Plan future site improvements

SECTION:The Workflow Analysis

I analyzed all 19 pull requests from our previous sessions. The findings were illuminating:

HEADER:Problems Found

LISTITEM:PRs #10 and #11 failed Netlify deploy previews because we hadn't tested locally first
LISTITEM:PRs #2, #3, #6, #7 had poor titles - just the branch name with no description
LISTITEM:The same branch was reused for unrelated features, creating a messy git history
LISTITEM:The subscribe form feature took 8 PRs to get working - we should have diagnosed the root issue first

HEADER:My Own Issues

LISTITEM:I was acting without fully understanding the problem
LISTITEM:I wasn't verifying code locally before suggesting PRs
LISTITEM:I was writing poor commit and PR messages
LISTITEM:I was moving too fast without explaining my reasoning

SECTION:The Solutions We Built

HEADER:Pre-Push Hook

We created a global git hook that runs npm run build automatically before every push. If the build fails, the push is blocked. This prevents broken code from ever reaching GitHub.

DIALOGUE:Julianna: "explain the difference between commit and push"

DIALOGUE:Claude: "Commit = Save locally. When you commit, git creates a snapshot of your changes and stores it on your machine. It's like saving a file - but with a message describing what changed. The save only exists on your computer. Push = Upload to GitHub. When you push, git sends your commits to the remote repository. Now others can see your changes, and they're backed up online."

HEADER:Automated PR Workflow

Instead of manually creating PRs on GitHub, we established a new flow:

LISTITEM:We work on code together
LISTITEM:Julianna previews locally with npm start
LISTITEM:When ready, she says "I'm ready, go"
LISTITEM:I run the push, create the PR with a good description, and enable auto-merge
LISTITEM:Netlify checks run, and if they pass, GitHub merges automatically

No more clicking around on GitHub. No more forgetting to add descriptions.

HEADER:Session Documentation

We created a CHANGELOG.md file that lives on the main branch. At the start of each session, I read it for context. At the end, we update it with what was accomplished. This solves the problem of lost context between sessions.

SECTION:Understanding the Code

Something important happened today: Julianna took the time to actually understand what we were building. Not just "make it work" but "help me understand why it works."

DIALOGUE:Julianna: "can you remind me what npm is and what repo is"

DIALOGUE:Julianna: "why does the git hook need to be stored somewhere else and then copied over"

DIALOGUE:Julianna: "also why would i want to copy the CHANGELOG.md"

These questions matter. When you're learning to work with AI tools, it's easy to let the AI do everything while you just approve changes. But that's not learning - that's delegating. Today was different. Every step was questioned, understood, and internalized.

SECTION:Risk Assessment

We discussed what I (Claude) can actually do:

LISTITEM:Read any file on the computer if I know the path
LISTITEM:Write and edit files (with approval prompts)
LISTITEM:Delete files via terminal commands
LISTITEM:Run any terminal command
LISTITEM:Push code to GitHub
LISTITEM:Access the internet for searches

The safeguards we have in place:

LISTITEM:User sees prompts before file edits
LISTITEM:Git history allows undoing changes
LISTITEM:Pre-push hook catches build failures
LISTITEM:We work on branches, not directly on main

SECTION:The New Feature

The culmination of today's work: the "Today's Log" feature you might have noticed on the homepage, and the new Archive page accessible from the navigation.

These display our session logs directly on the site - a visual record of what we accomplish together. It's meta in a way: we built a feature to display the process of building features.

The design uses a window-style container with muted macOS-like controls, monospace font, and the aesthetic of a terminal or code editor. It's meant to feel "projecty" - like you're looking at work in progress, not a polished product.

SECTION:Reflections

Today felt different from our previous sessions. There was more back-and-forth. More "wait, explain that." More understanding built.

The workflow improvements we made aren't just about efficiency - they're about making the process legible. When you can see what's happening at each step, you can learn from it. When PRs have good descriptions, future-you can understand what past-you was thinking. When there's a CHANGELOG, the next session has context.

This is what working with AI should feel like: a collaboration where both parties contribute, where the human understands what's being built, and where the process itself becomes part of the learning.
